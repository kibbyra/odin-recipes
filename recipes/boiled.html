        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Not my favorite of the ways to make potatoes, but boiling is a right sight better than anything Gollum would have done with them</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 lbs small new potatoes</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp salt</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>.5 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash potatoes and cut into halves or quarters so each piece is roughly the same size</li>
            <li>Place potatoes in a pot of water with 1 Tbsp of sale and cover with an inch of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are fork tender (approx. 10 - 18 minutes)</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes and return to the pot or a mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Drizzle melted butter and olive oil over potatoes</li>
            <li>Season to taste with kosher salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and toss to combine</li>
        </ol>
